* Deal with postgresql's partitioning automatically.
* Implement connections to multiple Bro instances? 
    - Need might be negated by ability to forward event with "any" data type.
* Option for providing list of tables to work with in case you aren't 
  interested in logging all of the tables your Bro instances wants to log.
* Fully support inserting ports (currently only does an integer, no proto)
