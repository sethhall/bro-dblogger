BUILDING
--------
Include the appropriate -L and -I flags for PostgreSQL and Broccoli
in the Makefile and type 'make'.  I'll fix this at some point. :)

USAGE
-----
Your Bro host will need to load the dblog.bro script to allow 
bro-dblogger to connect and begin receiving its events.  The dblog.bro script
also defines the event prototypes that are needed for the bro-dblogger to work.

By default, the dblog.bro script allows bro-dblogger to run on the local host,
but it could be changed so that the database insertion process could run on 
a separate machine.

The bro-dblogger application shows it's usage with the -h flag.
