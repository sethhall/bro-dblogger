ABOUT
-----------
This application is for taking data from the Bro-IDS (http://www.bro-ids.org/)
and inserting it in realtime into a PostgreSQL database.

BUILDING
----------
Include the appropriate -L and -I flags for PostgreSQL and Broccoli
in the Makefile and type 'make'.  I'll fix this at some point. :)

RUNNING IT
----------
Your Bro host will need to load the dblog.bro script to allow 
bro-dblogger to connect and begin receiving its events.  The dblog.bro script
also defines the event prototypes that are needed for the bro-dblogger to work.
You need to make sure you're also loading listen-clear for Bro to open a port 
for remote communications.

By default, the dblog.bro script allows bro-dblogger to run on the local host,
but it could be changed so that the database insertion process could run on 
a separate machine.

The bro-dblogger application shows it's usage with the -h flag.

USAGE
----------
To use bro-dblogger from Bro, you need to throw the db_log event.  Here's 
the prototype:
  global db_log(db_table: string, data: any);

"table" is the name of the table in which you'd like to put the data.
"data" is a record in which the field names equate directly to the column 
names in your database.  

Here's how to throw the event properly...
  event db_log("conns", [$epoch=network_time(),
                         $orig_h=id$orig_h, 
                         $orig_p=id$orig_p, 
                         $resp_h=id$resp_h, 
                         $resp_p=id$resp_p]);
